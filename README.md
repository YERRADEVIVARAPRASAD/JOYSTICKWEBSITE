#Wireframing Process

#Understanding User Requirements:

Define user personas and use cases.

#Sketching Low-Fidelity Wireframes:

Create rough sketches of page layouts on paper or using digital tools.

Focus on structural layout rather than design details.

#Creating Digital Wireframes:

Use Figma or Adobe XD to design digital wireframes.

Define the structure of pages with placeholders for images, text, and buttons.

Use grayscale elements to avoid distraction.

#Review and Feedback:

Share wireframes with stakeholders and collect feedback.

Make necessary modifications before proceeding to prototyping.

Prototyping Process

#Setting Up the UI Components:

Design individual UI elements such as buttons, navigation bars, and cards.

Use reusable components for consistency.

#Defining Interactions and Transitions:

Link pages using Figma or Adobe XDâ€™s interactive prototype mode.

Apply hover effects, click transitions, and animations.

#Testing User Flow:

Ensure smooth navigation across screens.

Simulate user actions like clicks, scrolls, and form submissions.

#User Testing and Refinement:

Conduct usability testing to identify pain points.

Modify interactions based on feedback.

#Finalizing and Exporting Prototypes:

Share the prototype link for stakeholder approval.

Export assets for developers in the required formats.
